                        <p>The first goal for St. Louis University again came quickly Saturday night at Duke, something coach Kevin Kalish has come to expect, or at least have high on his wish list 
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The Billikens, who are the No. 10 overall seed, advance to a game at No. 2 seed Washington. The time and date of that game had not been set as of Sunday morning.</p>
                        <p>“I can’t remember many games that we haven’t started well,” Kalish said. “It’s a mature group that understands how important the first goal is and the importance of the first 15 minutes. We executed well again.”</p>
                        <p>Kavin kalish is the coach for the slu soccer team from past five years.</p>
                        <p>A wild offensive soccer game loaded with big individual plays was decided by an own goal following a SLU.</p>
                    
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> The Final Won the Match Missouri State in june 2020 </h2>
                        <p>we all are very happy after wing the matche.</p>
                        <p>Duke started the game without leading goal scorer Thorleifur Ulfarsson, who was pulled from the lineup after he repeatedly taunted UCLA’s goalkeeper in the Blue Devils’ previous game after Duke scored the winning goal.SLU led 1-0 before Duke tied the game early in the second half on a header by Ulfarsson. The Billikens then opened a 3-1 lead only to see the Blue Devils battle back to tie the game again.”</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The Billikens mounted most of the early pressure and broke through when Leeth was able to control a long ball served into the box by midfielder Christian Buendia. Leeth turned and put his shot past Hamil</blockquote>
                        <p>SSLU outshot Duke 7-4 before halftime and had a 5-1 advantage on corner kicks, but both teams had only one shot on goal in the half. Shakur Mohammed had Duke’s, but he couldn’t get much on the ball as he aimed for the left corner and Schulte made an easy save, one of his four in the game.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Its a honer to SLU Soccer team</h2>
                        <p>“They have a lot of talented attackers on the field, and they added another one as the game wore on,” he said. “We knew we were going to have to box defend well and get through some moments of pressure. And we knew we could hit them in transition, which we did.”</p>

                        <p>SLU’s second goal came when Becher chased down a long ball in the left corner and centered to Klein, who slipped a shot between the legs of the goalkeeper. Becher made it 3-1 when he fooled a defender on a pass from Alex Shterenberg and then hit a left footer into the far corner of the goal.</</p>
